					<h3>Appendix C: Results</h3>
					<hr>
					<h4 style='font-weight:bold;'>Is "Identity Resolution" even possible?</h4>
					<p style='font-size:80%;'>A: Yes. We have already been able to find the facebook and twitter profiles of 350 of Nancy Pelosi's donors. The industry standard for identity resolution across social media profiles is 40%. We can find the donors.</p>
					<hr>

					<h4 style='font-weight:bold;'>Does language indicate anything about political behavior?</h4>
					<p style='font-size:80%;'>A: Yes. Using only "stopwords", which measure speaking style, we can classify congresspeople as Democrat or Republican with 70% accuracy. Psychology and linguistics research suggests that we can also computationally identify traits like egotism or socio-economic status based on the language people use.</p>
